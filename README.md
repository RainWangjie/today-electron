> An app helps you to remember things and evaluates your productivity. WIP.

[中文说明](../README-CN.md)

Today is a cross-platform GTP application built on the power of Electron and Vue.js and with :heart:. It helps you to keep track of your tasks, provide suggestions for today and evaluate how productive you are.

A glance of what you can do with Today:

* Add a To-Do, set due date and plan date, and write a description.
* Get suggestions from Today for today's jobs.
* See if you complete your planned To-Dos in Summary View.
